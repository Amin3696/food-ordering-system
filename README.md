# Food Ordering System

## Introduction

The Food Ordering System is a Spring Boot project that utilizes Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Event-Driven Design (EDD), Hexagonal Architecture, SAGA Architecture Pattern, Outbox Architecture Pattern, and CQRS Architecture Pattern. It leverages Apache Kafka for implementing event-driven services and uses PostgreSQL as the underlying database. The microservices are deployed to a local Kubernetes cluster and can be further deployed to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for production-ready environments.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built upon a set of microservices, each responsible for a specific domain within the food ordering process. The Hexagonal Architecture pattern is employed to achieve a clear separation of concerns and maintain modularity. This approach allows for independent development and deployment of microservices, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.

The Event-Driven Design pattern is implemented using Apache Kafka, which serves as the backbone for communication between microservices. Events are published and consumed asynchronously, ensuring loose coupling and enabling scalability and responsiveness.

The SAGA Architecture Pattern is used to handle long-running and complex business transactions. Sagas are choreographed using events to maintain data consistency across microservices, guaranteeing eventual consistency in the system.

The Outbox Architecture Pattern is adopted to ensure reliable event delivery. Each microservice maintains an outbox table, where events are stored before being published to Kafka. This pattern prevents data loss in case of service failures and provides reliable event sourcing.

The CQRS Architecture Pattern is employed for separating read and write operations. The system's write operations update the database and publish events, while the read operations are performed on a separate read model optimized for querying. This approach improves performance and scalability by allowing read and write models to scale independently.

## Deployment

For local development and testing, the microservices are deployed to a local Kubernetes cluster. This setup provides an environment that closely resembles a production-like system. The services can be accessed internally within the cluster, facilitating easy integration and testing.

For production deployment, the microservices can be deployed to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). GKE offers a managed Kubernetes environment with built-in scalability, security, and reliability features. It provides a robust infrastructure for running microservices at scale, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

The PostgreSQL database is used as the persistent data store. It offers a reliable and scalable solution for managing the application's data, supporting ACID transactions and providing data durability.

## Conclusion

The Food Ordering System embraces modern architectural patterns and technologies to deliver a scalable and reliable solution. The combination of DDD, EDD, Hexagonal Architecture, SAGA Architecture Pattern, Outbox Architecture Pattern, and CQRS Architecture Pattern ensures loose coupling, modularity, and maintainability. The use of Apache Kafka enables event-driven communication, while Kubernetes and PostgreSQL provide a robust deployment and data management environment. This system is well-suited for handling the complexities of food ordering processes, allowing for seamless integration and extensibility.
